# JUCE Plugin Work

This is my first attempt at writing an audio processing plugin using C++ with the JUCE Framework.

Using elayamirmusic's great repo structure, which saved a lot of Cmake headaches since this is my first C++ project.

Also relied on this guide by Matkat Music a lot, particularly for starting out - most of the filter/EQ code is used from here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Iq4_Kd7Rc
